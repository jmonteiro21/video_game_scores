# Supervised Learning: Predicting video games user review scores

This project consists in exploratory data analysis and the application of supervised learning
models to predict if a video game has good or bad user reviews, analyzing a
dataset of ~6000 videogames. The goal is to predict if the average users gave the video game a bad,
mediocre, good, or great score.
